🖥️ C Interpreter — Recursive Descent Parser & Shunting Yard Algorithm

Welcome to the C Interpreter Project, a powerful, lightweight interpreter designed for evaluating custom C-like programs. Built from scratch, this interpreter leverages advanced parsing techniques, including recursive descent parsing and the shunting yard algorithm for efficient expression evaluation.

🚀 Features

🔍 Recursive Descent Parser
A robust parsing engine that handles complex grammatical structures with ease, supporting expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions.
🧮 Shunting Yard Algorithm
Optimizes the evaluation of mathematical expressions, ensuring correct operator precedence and associativity.
🌳 Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) Representation
Utilizes an LCRS (Left-Child, Right-Sibling) binary tree structure to manage program syntax in an intuitive, memory-efficient format.
🏗️ Function Evaluation System
Supports custom functions, including a demonstration with sum_of_first_n_squares()—executed dynamically after evaluating the main() function.
🛠️ Modular Code Design
Easily extensible, making it simple to add new language features, operators, or syntax rules.
📚 How It Works

The interpreter follows a multi-stage process:

Lexical Analysis: Breaks down the source code into tokens.
Parsing: Uses recursive descent to build a syntax tree from the tokens.
Evaluation: Runs the program by traversing the CST and applying the shunting yard algorithm for expression resolution.
🔧 Build Instructions

Make sure you have CMake and a modern C++ compiler installed.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-interpreter.git
cd c-interpreter

# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Generate build files using CMake
cmake ..

# Compile the project
make

# Run the interpreter
./CS460_A6_Interpreter
📝 Usage Example

int sum_of_first_n_squares(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        sum = sum + (i * i);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int result = sum_of_first_n_squares(5);
    print(result); // Output: 55
}
